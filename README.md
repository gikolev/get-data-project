# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## README file

This repo contains the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.

The goal of the project is to collect, clean and turn a data set into tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

[CodeBook.md](..blob/master/CodeBook.md) describes the data, variables, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.

[run_analysis.R](..blob/master/run_analysis.R) contains the R script used to execute the manipulations described in CodeBook.

[tidy_data.txt](..blob/master/tidy_data.txt) contains the final output of the R script.

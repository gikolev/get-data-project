# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## README file

This repo contains the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.

The goal of the project is to collect, clean and turn a data set into tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

[CodeBook.md](https://github.com/gikolev/get-data-project/blob/master/CodeBook.md) describes the data, variables, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.

[run_analysis.R](https://github.com/gikolev/get-data-project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) contains the R script used to perform the manipulations described in CodeBook.

[tidy_data.txt](https://github.com/gikolev/get-data-project/blob/master/tidy_data.txt) is a .txt version of the tidy data frame produced by running the R script.
